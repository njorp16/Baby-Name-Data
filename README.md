# Baby-Name-Data

## Overview
Manipulate and visualize the frequency of baby name usage using Python with matplotlib and pandas.

## Data Source
The `names.zip` file contains multiple `.txt` files. Each file represents a year and contains data in the format: name, gender, and the number of people with those attributes.

### Example
In the file `yob1880.txt`, a line like:

Mary,F,7065

indicates that in the year 1880, there were 7065 females named Mary.

## Functionality
The program processes this data to analyze the popularity of certain names for any given year. Utilizing libraries such as matplotlib and pandas, it provides visualizations and insights into trends in baby names over the years.
